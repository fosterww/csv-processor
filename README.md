CSV Processor

A Python script to parse and summarize CSV data using Pandas. This project demonstrates data processing, error handling, and command-line interface (CLI) skills, built as part of my journey to become a Junior Python Developer. Features include Load CSV, Reads CSV file, and command-line interface (CLI) skills.
Features

    Load CSV: Reads a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame with robust error handling.
    Summarize Data: Computes summaries like average, total, and counts by category (e.g., average age, total salary, department counts).
    Save Output: Saves summaries to a text file (summary.txt).
    CLI Support: Accepts a CSV file path via command-line arguments.
    Portfolio-Ready: Clean, modular code with PEP 8 compliance and detailed documentation.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.10 or higher
    Pandas (pip install pandas)

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/fosterww/csv-processor.git
cd csv-processor
Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash

    pip install pandas

Usage

    Prepare a CSV file (e.g., data.csv) with columns like name, age, salary, and department. Example:
    csv

name,age,salary,department
Alice,25,50000,HR
Bob,30,60000,IT
Charlie,35,55000,HR
Dave,28,62000,IT
Run the script:
bash

    python csv_processor.py data.csv
    View output:
        Summaries are printed to the console.
        A summary.txt file is created with the results.

Example Output

Console:
text
Data Summary:
Average Age: 29.5
Total Salary: 227000
Department Counts: {'HR': 2, 'IT': 2}
Summary saved to summary.txt

summary.txt:
text
Data Summary
============
Average Age: 29.5
Total Salary: 227000
Department Counts: {'HR': 2, 'IT': 2}
Project Structure

    csv_processor.py: Main script to load, process, and summarize CSV data.
    data.csv: Sample CSV file for testing.
    summary.txt: Output file with summarized data.
    README.md: This documentation.

How It Works

    Load Data: Uses Pandas pd.read_csv() to load the CSV file, with error handling for invalid files or formats.
    Summarize Data: Computes metrics like average age, total salary, and department counts using Pandas.
    Save Results: Writes summaries to summary.txt for persistence.
    CLI Integration: Uses argparse to accept the CSV file path via the command line.

Testing

    Valid CSV: Run with data.csv to verify summaries.
    Edge Cases: Tested with:
        Non-existent files (shows "File not found" error).
        Empty CSV files (shows "CSV is empty" error).
        Invalid CSV formats (shows "Invalid CSV format" error).
    Code Quality: Follows PEP 8, checked with flake8.

To test, install Flake8 (pip install flake8) and run:
bash
flake8 csv_processor.py
Future Improvements

    Add visualizations (e.g., Matplotlib charts for department counts).
    Support multiple CSV files or custom summary metrics.
    Integrate a web interface for interactive data exploration.

About

This project was built to practice Python data processing skills, including Pandas, error handling, and CLI development. Itâ€™s part of my portfolio to demonstrate backend and data manipulation capabilities for a Junior Python Developer role.
